  Easily the most commonly-asked question among non-technical startup founders is: “How do I recruit a technical cofounder?”.
  Aspiring entrepreneurs usually don't have enough tech skills to build a functional prototype or MVP, nor enough money to
  hire developers.

  We help startups at the early ideation stage to build a functional prototype so they can validate their idea – fast. We will
  build an MVP so they can get early customers and be in a better position to secure early-stage funding. We can take them
  even further by delivering complex, high-quality solutions.

  We are expirienced software developers and have an extensive background in developing custom software solutions in many different
  industries and project sizes. We are big proponents of Agile practises and Lean principles. We were involved in many successful
  projects, and a few failures. We've learned the biggest reasons why software projects fail and how to mitigate risks and
  deliver value through continuous validation of small functionality improvements. We built a few prototypes and MVPs for
  startups, and got quite efficient at this process. Today, we can take a project through the early stages of prototyping
  and MVP very quickly and efficiently. This allows startups to validate their idea and decide to pivot or continue development.
  This also helps to raise capital by having an MVP and potentially early customers.

  We attended training at the Founder Institute, and have experience working on multiple startups. We know how to move quickly,
  what steps to take, and how to overcome common obstacles when running a startup. We also know – and have personally experienced
  – many of the pitfalls and reasons for failure. That’s why we're capable of going beyond just a tech role and becoming
  a true adviser and a driving force for a startup.
